|      2 |                   \0 | p2 points to array[10] -> \0 								   |
|      3 |                    1 | address of array[0] is smaller than the address of array[10] -> 1 (true) 		   |
|      4 |                    1 | address of array[2] is smaller than the address of array[6]  -> 1 (true) 	           |
|      5 |                   0  | address of p1 shifted by 2*sizeof(int32_t) is not smaller than p2 anylonger -> 0 (false) |
|      6 |                   10 | retrieves how many characters are in between the two pointer 				   |
